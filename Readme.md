- [Sub Strings](https://github.com/Muhammad-Taha-Qader/Ruby/blob/main/Basic/substrings.rb)
- [Sub Strings Multiwords]()
    
    Write a method `substrings(dictionary, text)` that returns a hash with the count of how many times each word in the `dictionary` appears as a substring in `text`. The search should be case-insensitive, and only words that occur in the `text` should be included in the result. Each occurrence should be counted, even if it's part of a longer word.
    
    Example:
    
    For the dictionary `["how", "it", "sit"]` and text `"How's it going? Sit down!"`, the result should be:
    
    `{ "how" => 1, "it" => 2, "sit" => 1 }`
